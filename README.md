<ul>

<li>This is a guessing game using numbers where the player will guess with numbers.</li>
<li>There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.</li>
<li>The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.</li>
<li>When the player clicks on a crystal it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.</li>
<li>The player wins the game if their total score matches the random number and the player loses the game if their total score goes above the random number.</li>
<li>The amount of points each crystal adds is not shown to the player, but their total score is displayed and updated after each crystal is clicked.</li>
<li>The number of games won and lost will be displayed.</li>
<li>If the player successfully matches their total score to the random number they get 1 win, if the player's total score is above the random number the player get 1 loss, either way the game restarts.</li>
